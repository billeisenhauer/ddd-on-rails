# DDD on Rails

An exploratory project to recreate the Cargo app from the Domain-Driven Design
book using the Ruby on Rails framework along with a hexagonal architecture.

## Description

The goal of the project is to see what the Cargo app would look if built in
Rails.  More importantly, this project represents a substantive example of
using DDD along with a Hexagonal Architecture.

Why do this?

Just lived through enough difficult-to-maintain Rails projects, so want to see
if there is a better way out there.
